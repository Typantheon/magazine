            <p>Dionysus was so much more than just the <span class="domain" about="dionysus" id="mention-4" data-sort="wine" data-label="domains">master of the vine</span>; he was also charged with <span class="domain" about="dionysus" id="mention-5" data-sort="fertility" data-label="domains">fertility</span>, <span class="domain" about="dionysus" id="mention-6" data-sort="fruitfulness" data-label="domains">fruitfulness</span>, <span class="domain" about="dionysus" id="mention-7" data-label="domains" data-sort="theater">theater</span>, <span class="domain" about="dionysus" id="mention-8" data-sort="ecstasy" data-label="domains">ecstasy</span>, and <span class="domain" about="dionysus" id="mention-9" data-sort="abandon" data-label="domains">abandon</span>.

Though his <span class="culture" about="dionysus" id="mention-13" data-sort="paganism" data-label="religion">pagan</span>-like cults and mysteries may seem to have existed outside the usual <span class="culture" about="dionysus" id="mention-14" data-sort="greco-roman" data-label="culture">Greco-Roman</span> religious and philosophical spheres, archaeological evidence in the 20th century proved that he was a fully realized god.</p>
            <figure><img src="../images/dionysus-1.jpg" id="img-dionysus-1" class="full-width"><figcaption class="caption">Dionysus is depicted as an older man on a sixth-century B.C. plate from the British Museum.<br>PHOTOGRAPH BY ACI</figcaption></figure><p>The son of an immortal god and a mortal princess, Dionysus’ role forged a crucial link between humanity and the divine, serving as a force of cyclical, unbridled nature who drew men and women out of themselves through intoxication. In that sense, Dionysus, a genial but wild and dangerously ravishing intermediary, represents one of the enduring mysteries and paradoxes of life.</p>
            <p>Dionysus’ association with wine embodies this paradox. Wine is a delicious beverage with medicinal properties, but it also intoxicates. It brings liberation and ecstasy, yet, like any initiatory experience, it also introduced the risks of losing hold of identity and control.</p>
            <h2>Births and deaths</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Many of the myths centered on Dionysus come from different sources. One of the most popular, the <span class="literature" about="dionysus" id="mention-15" data-sort="bibliotecha" data-label="historical">Bibliotheca</span>, is a first- or second-century A.D. compendium of myths that draws on earlier sources, such as the <span class="literature" about="dionysus" id="mention-16" data-sort="homeric hymns" data-label="poems">Homeric Hymns</span> from the seventh to sixth centuries B.C. as well as earlier Greek plays and poems. These texts supply a standard story of Dionysus’ birth: Like many of <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-17" data-sort="zeus">Zeus</span>’s children, Dionysus was not the son of Zeus’s wife and queen, <span class="connection" about="hera" id="mention-18" data-sort="hera">Hera</span>, but the product of an extramarital affair. In Bibliotheca, falls in love with a mortal princess <span class="connection" about="semele" id="mention-19" data-sort="semele" data-label="gods">Semele</span>, and the two conceive a child. When Hera discovers the relationship, her jealousy drives her to try to destroy Semele and her unborn son.</p><br>

            <p>Disguised as a mortal, Hera plants a seed of doubt in the young woman’s mind that her lover isn’t a god and then gives her a way to obtain proof. Semele follows Hera’s plan and has Zeus swear an unbreakable oath to grant her any wish; then she asks Zeus to appear before her in all his divine glory. Because of his oath, Zeus cannot refuse and reveals his divinity, a sight that mortals cannot withstand. Semele burns to ashes.</p>
            <p>Zeus manages to save their unborn son and sews him into his own leg. When gestation is complete, Dionysus bursts forth from Zeus’s thigh. This graphic and gruesome episode is not an unprecedented one in Greek mythology: <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-20" data-sort="athena" data-label="gods">Athena</span>, goddess of wisdom and warfare, was born similarly, emerging fully formed from Zeus’s head.

Hera’s jealous rage does not end with Semele’s death. She aims to punish Semele’s son, too, and decides to drive Dionysus mad. Stricken, the young god wanders aimlessly through the lands east of <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-26" data-sort="greece" data-label="region">Greece</span>, winding up first in <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-27" data-sort="phrygia" data-label="region">Phrygia</span>, a kingdom in the west-central part of <span class="place" about="dionysian" id="mention-28" data-sort="anatolia" data-label="region">Anatolia</span> (modern <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-29" data-sort="turkey" data-label="region">Turkey</span>). There, the mother goddess <span class="connection" about="cybele" id="mention-30" data-sort="cybele" data-label="gods">Cybele</span>—whose own cult was associated with, and apparently resembled, Dionysus’ retinue—purifies him, perhaps recognizing a kindred spirit.</p>
            <h2>Wanderings and wine</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Cured of his madness, Dionysus continues to travel, and he is not alone. In many of the tales surrounding him, he is accompanied by an entourage who worship Dionysus in a state of drunken revelry, holding lavish festal orgia (rites) in his honor. Among them are nymphs called <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-31" data-sort="maenads" data-label="nymphs">maenads</span>—also known as the <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-32" data-sort="bacchae" data-label="nymphs">Bacchae</span>, or bacchantes, who form the crux of his traveling retinue (the thiasus).</p>
            <p><span class="connection" about="pan" id="mention-33" data-sort="pan" data-label="gods">Pan</span>, the hirsute fertility god associated with shepherds, often took part, along with satyrs and <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-34" data-sort="sileni" data-label="sileni">sileni</span>—wild creatures that were part man, part beast. The thiasus comprised animals such as big cats (leopards, tigers, lynx) and snakes as well. The group brings the gift of wine wherever it goes.</p><br>

            <p>Dionysus’ odyssey takes him from Greece across Turkey and into <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-37" data-sort="asia" data-label="region">Asia</span>. Some modern scholars theorize that ancient Greeks believed that anywhere grapevines could be found and wine was cultivated, Dionysus had once visited. When Dionysus reaches India, on a chariot pulled by panthers, he conquers the land with wine and dance rather than weapons and war.</p>
            <p>Dionysus encounters different peoples and not all welcome him. Those who reject his teachings are swiftly and brutally punished. In <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-38" data-sort="thrace" data-label="region">Thrace</span> (parts of modern <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-39" data-sort="bulgaria" data-label="region">Bulgaria</span>, Greece, and Turkey), he encounters <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-40" data-sort="lycurgus" data-label="historical">King Lycurgus</span>, who refuses to recognize his status as a god and imprisons his followers.

            <p>A similar incident occurs in Thebes, the native city of Dionysus’ mother, the princess Semele. The story is the basis of Euripides’ dramatic masterpiece of the late fifth century B.C., The Bacchae. The god’s cousin King Pentheus opposes the Dionysian cult and provokes the god’s anger. Pentheus spies on a group of Theban women practicing their bacchanalian rites on a mountainside. The frenzied women—which included Pentheus’s own mother, Agave— mistake him for a wild animal, and tear him apart with their bare hands in their intoxication.</p>
            <p>Dionysus was not always cruel. When a band of Tyrrhenian pirates kidnapped the god off the west coast of what is now <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-47" data-sort="italy" data-label="region">Italy</span>, Dionysus responds by having grapevines sprout all over the ship. Realizing they were in the presence of a god, the terrified pirates threw themselves into the sea. Rather than let them drown, Dionysus transformed the sailors into dolphins.</p>

            <h2>Performance and mysteries</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Worship of Dionysus was not uniform in the classic world. Some of it was public and organised, while other rituals were mysterious and carried out in secret. Many Greeks showed their reverence for Dionysus through festivals; in <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-48" data-sort="rome" data-label="city">Rome</span>, where he was called Bacchus, these became the <span class="ritual" data-label="rituals" data-sort="bacchanalia" about="dionysus" id="mention-49">Bacchanalia</span>—wild rituals celebrated at night in forests and mountains. The maenads would enter a delirious state of ecstasy, then— inspired by the personification of Dionysus in the form of a priest—dance wildly before setting out on a hunt.</p>

            <p>In the days that followed, ancient Greece’s playwrights would present their works—tragedies, comedies, and satyric drama—and compete for top honors. (According to tradition, tragedy was originally related to songs from the Dionysian feast of the tragos, goat, and oidos, song). Actors who gave the best performances would also be awarded prizes. Those taking first place would be given wreaths of ivy, in a nod to the patron god of wine.</p>

LEWANDOWSKI/RMN-GRAND PALAIS</figcaption></figure>
            <p>Dionysus was also worshipped through a series of secret rituals known today as the <span class="ritual" data-label="rituals" data-sort="dionysian mysteries" about="dionysus" id="mention-50">Dionysian Mysteries</span>. These are thought to have evolved from an unknown cult that spread throughout the Mediterranean region alongside the dissemination of wine (though it’s possible that mead was the original sacrament).</p>
            <p>As the patron of the Dionysian Mysteries—secret rites to which only initiates were admitted, such as those performed in honor of <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-51" data-sort="demeter" data-label="gods">Demeter</span>, goddess of agriculture, and later, of <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-52" data-sort="isis" data-label="gods">Isis</span> (originally from <span class="place" about="isis" id="mention-53" data-sort="egypt" data-label="region">Egypt</span>) and <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-54" data-sort="mithras" data-label="gods">Mithras</span> (originally from <span class="place" about="mithras" id="mention-55" data-sort="iran" data-label="region">Iran</span>)—Dionysus was a disruptive deity, entering civilization and throwing out the established order. When he arrived, liberation and transgression had their turn.</p>

            <h2>Outsider or Olympian?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>At first glance these mysteries, and the orgiastic rites that surrounded Dionysus, seem to run counter to the harmonious and ordered view of classical Greek religion. For this reason, many scholars, especially of the German tradition, for a long time did not believe that Dionysus could be truly <span class="culture" about="dionysus" id="mention-58" data-sort="hellenic">Hellenic</span>. They considered him to be a foreign god, perhaps Thracian or Phrygian, and discounted the possibility that the myths around his death and resurrection could be Greek. Positivist scholars of the 19th century argued that Dionysus was an imported rather than a Greek god, and that the maenads existed only in myth and literature.</p>

                <h3>DELIRIUM OF "THE BACCHAE"</h3>
                <figure><img src="../images/Picture1.jpg" class="full-width"><figcaption class="caption">Two theatrical masks—one tragic, one comic—adorn this marble relief from the second century A.D.<br>IMAGE COURTESY OF BRITISH MUSEUM/SCALA, FLORENCE</figcaption></figure><br>
                <p>The chorus of Euripides’ tragedy The Bacchae, written around 405 B.C., evokes the Dionysian mystery rites:</p>
                <blockquote>The chorus of Euripides’ tragedy The Bacchae, written around 405 B.C., evokes the Dionysian mystery rites:</blockquote>
                <p>Euripides describes the ecstasy that Dionysus unleashes among his retinue:</p>
                <blockquote>"Go, Bacchae, go, Bacchae . . . sing of Dionysus, beneath the heavy beat of drums, celebrating in delight the god of delight with Phrygian shouts and cries, when the sweet-sounding sacred pipe sounds a sacred playful tune suited to the wanderers, to the mountain, to the mountain!” And the Bacchante, rejoicing like a foal with its grazing mother, rouses her swift foot in a gamboling dance.</blockquote>
            </div>
            <p>These preconceptions changed over the course of the 20th century. In 1953, thanks to the decipherment of Linear B script—the writing system used by the <span class="culture" about="dionysus" id="mention-59" data-sort="mycenaean" data-label="culture">Mycenaean</span> civilization, which predates the Greek alphabet by several centuries—researchers learned that Dionysus was indeed known in Greece as far back as the 13th century B.C. Ancient Mycenaean tablets found in the palace of <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-60" data-sort="pylos" data-label="places" data-label="city">Pylos</span>, in the <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-61" data-sort="peloponnese" data-label="region">Peloponnese</span> region of southern Greece, mention his name and prove that Dionysus was not a god adopted from abroad, but a profoundly Greek divinity.</p>
            <p>Evidence of the maenads existence has been found as well, in Greek inscriptions from various time periods. Apparently there really were groups of women who would reach such a state of delirium, under the influence of Dionysus’ priestly incarnation, that they were prepared to rip apart live animals and eat their raw flesh.</p>

            <h2>Divine influence</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Dionysus was thus a fully Greek god, whose popularity has spanned different time periods and guises; he is depicted as both a beautifully effeminate, long-haired youth and a corpulent, bearded mature man. The Greek Dionysus and the Roman Bacchus are functionally the same god, but there are a few key differences. Dionysus—a noble, youthful figure in myth and classical literature—is usually listed alongside the 12 Olympian gods. Bacchus, on the other hand, is often seen as a portly older man who, according to the Roman poet <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-62" data-sort="ovid" data-label="poet">Ovid</span>, could be vengeful, using his staff as both a magic wand and a weapon against those who dared oppose his cult and its ideals of freedom.</p>

            <p>Surveying different belief systems in the ancient world, it is easy to spot Dionysus’ influence in other traditions. The term “<span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-63" data-sort="osiris" data-label="gods">Osiris</span>-Dionysus” is used by some historians of religion to refer to a group of gods worshipped around the Mediterranean in the centuries prior to the emergence of Christianity.

            <p>The Egyptian god Osiris, for instance, was equated with Dionysus by the Greek historian <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-66" data-sort="herodotus" data-label="historian">Herodotus</span> during the fifth century B.C. By late antiquity, some gnostic and Neoplatonist philosophers had expanded the syncretic equation to include <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-67" data-sort="aion" data-label="gods">Aion</span>, <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-68" data-sort="adonis" data-label="gods">Adonis</span>, and other gods of the mystery religions. Scholars also note links between the life-giving wine of the Dionysian cult and the centrality of wine in the Christ in the context of an eastern Mediterranean tradition of dying-and-rising gods, whose sacrifice and resurrection redeemed their people.</p>
            <p>Clearly Dionysus continues to cast a long shadow. Given the prevalence and power of wine and early ecstasy, it is no mystery why.</p>

                <p>A Roman sarcophagus from the third century A.D. depicts Dionysus discovering the sleeping mortal princess Ariadne. The pair fell in love, married, and had children, including Oenopian (the personification of wine), Staphylus (associated with grapes), and Thoas. This magnificent composition depicts a well-known episode from classical mythology. After helping the Athenian prince <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-74" data-sort="theseus" data-label="hero">Theseus</span> kill the monstrous <span class="connection" about="minotaur" id="mention-75" data-sort="minotaur">Minotaur</span>, Ariadne, daughter of <span class="connection" about="dionysus" id="mention-76" data-sort="minos" data-label="fictional">King Minos</span> of Crete, flees with him. Theseus cruelly abandons her on <span class="place" about="dionysus" id="mention-77" data-sort="naxos" data-label="places">the island of Naxos</span>, and she is devastated by his abandonment. Ariadne falls asleep and is discovered by Dionysus, who arrives on Naxos accompanied by his retinue. He immediately falls in love with her, and they marry. The decoration of the sarcophagus shows a band of satyrs playing instruments and maenads dancing wildly. Centaurs appear as well, including a mother holding her little son in her arms. The episode is a fitting scene for a sarcophagus like this one, from the third century A.D.: There is a parallel between a deceased person’s hope for salvation after death and the immortality that Dionysus grants Ariadne. Near the top of the facade is a human figure whose features are unfinished. It may have meant to be the deceased, whose features may also have supplied the likeness for the unfinished Ariadne. Likewise, a central blank space at the top was possibly intended for an inscription.</p>
