            <hr>
            <p>Dionysus was so much more than just the <span class="domain" about="dyonisus" id="mention-4" data-sort="wine" data-label="domains">master of the vine</span>; he was also charged with <span class="domain" about="dyonisus" id="mention-5" data-sort="fertility" data-label="domains">fertility</span>, <span class="domain" about="dyonisus" id="mention-6" data-sort="fruitfulness" data-label="domains">fruitfulness</span>, <span class="domain" about="dyonisus" id="mention-7" data-label="domains" data-sort="theater">theater</span>, <span class="domain" about="dyonisus" id="mention-8" data-sort="ecstasy" data-label="domains">ecstasy</span>, and <span class="domain" about="dyonisus" id="mention-9" data-sort="abandon" data-label="domains">abandon</span>. Whether called Dionysus (his Greek name) or <span class="epithet" about="dyonisus" id="mention-1" data-sort="bacchus">Bacchus</span> (his Roman one), he is perhaps the strangest of the gods in the vast <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-10" data-sort="classical">classical pantheons</span>. Though his <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-11" data-sort="paganism">pagan</span>-like cults and mysteries may seem to have existed outside the usual <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-12" data-sort="greco-roman">Greco-Roman</span> religious and philosophical spheres, archaeological evidence in the 20th century proved that he was a fully realized god.</p>
            <figure><img src="../images/dyonisus-1.jpg" id="img-dyonisus-1" class="full-width"><figcaption class="caption">Dionysus is depicted as an older man on a sixth-century B.C. plate from the British Museum.<br>PHOTOGRAPH BY ACI</figcaption></figure><p>The son of an immortal god and a mortal princess, Dionysus’ role forged a crucial link between humanity and the divine, serving as a force of cyclical, unbridled nature who drew men and women out of themselves through intoxication. In that sense, Dionysus, a genial but wild and dangerously ravishing intermediary, represents one of the enduring mysteries and paradoxes of life.</p>
            <p>Dionysus’ association with wine embodies this paradox. Wine is a delicious beverage with medicinal properties, but it also intoxicates. It brings liberation and ecstasy, yet, like any initiatory experience, it also introduced the risks of losing hold of identity and control.</p>
            <h2>Births and deaths</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Many of the myths centered on Dionysus come from different sources. One of the most popular, the <span class="literature" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="bibliotecha">Bibliotheca</span>, is a first- or second-century A.D. compendium of myths that draws on earlier sources, such as the <span class="literature" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="homeric hymns">Homeric Hymns</span> from the seventh to sixth centuries B.C. as well as earlier Greek plays and poems. These texts supply a standard story of Dionysus’ birth: Like many of <span class="person" about="zeus" id="mention-14" data-sort="zeus">Zeus</span>’s children, Dionysus was not the son of <span class="person" about="zeus" id="mention-15" data-sort="zeus">Zeus</span>’s wife and queen, <span class="person" about="hera" id="mention-16" data-sort="hera">Hera</span>, but the product of an extramarital affair. In the <span class="literature" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="bibliotheca">Bibliotheca</span>, <span class="person" about="zeus" id="mention-17" data-sort="zeus">Zeus</span> falls in love with a mortal princess <span class="person" about="semele" id="mention-18" data-sort="semele">Semele</span>, and the two conceive a child.

            <h2>Wanderings and wine</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Cured of his madness, Dionysus continues to travel, and he is not alone. In many of the tales surrounding him, he is accompanied by an entourage who worship Dionysus in a state of drunken revelry, holding lavish festal orgia (rites) in his honor. Among them are <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-47" data-sort="nymphs">nymphs</span> called <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-48" data-sort="maenads">maenads</span>—also known as the <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-49" data-sort="bacchae">Bacchae</span>, or bacchantes, who form the crux of his traveling retinue (the thiasus).</p>

            <p>Dionysus’ odyssey takes him from <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="greece">Greece</span> across <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="turkey">Turkey</span> and into <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="asia">Asia</span>. Some modern scholars theorize that ancient Greeks believed that anywhere grapevines could be found and wine was cultivated, Dionysus had once visited. When Dionysus reaches <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="india">India</span>, on a chariot pulled by panthers, he conquers the land with wine and dance rather than weapons and war.</p>
            <p>Dionysus encounters different peoples and not all welcome him. Those who reject his teachings are swiftly and brutally punished. In <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="thrace">Thrace</span> (parts of modern <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="bulgaria">Bulgaria</span>, <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="greece">Greece</span>, and <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="turkey">Turkey</span>), he encounters <span class="person" about="lycurgus" id="mention-48" data-sort="lycurgus">King Lycurgus</span>, who refuses to recognize his status as a god and imprisons his followers. To demonstrate his power, Dionysus drives the king insane. <span class="person" about="lycurgus" id="mention-48" data-sort="lycurgus">Lycurgus</span> kills his own son after mistaking him for a grapevine. Recovering his senses, the king is horrified, but Dionysus is not satisfied. He demands that the king be put to death or no fruit will grow in the kingdom. On hearing that, the king’s people seize <span class="person" about="lycurgus" id="mention-48" data-sort="lycurgus">Lycurgus</span> and feed him to man-eating horses to appease the god.</p><br>

            <p>A similar incident occurs in <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="thebes">Thebes</span>, the native city of Dionysus’ mother, the princess Semele. The story is the basis of <span class="person" about="euripides" id="mention-48" data-sort="euripides">Euripides</span>’ dramatic masterpiece of the late fifth century B.C., <span class="literature" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="the bacchae">The Bacchae</span>. The god’s cousin <span class="person" about="pentheus" id="mention-48" data-sort="pentheus">King Pentheus</span> opposes the Dionysian cult and provokes the god’s anger. <span class="person" about="pentheus" id="mention-48" data-sort="pentheus">Pentheus</span> spies on a group of Theban women practicing their bacchanalian rites on a mountainside. The frenzied women—which included <span class="person" about="pentheus" id="mention-48" data-sort="pentheus">Pentheus</span>’s own mother, <span class="person" about="agave" id="mention-48" data-sort="agave">Agave</span>— mistake him for a wild animal, and tear him apart with their bare hands in their intoxication.</p>
            <p>Dionysus was not always cruel. When a band of Tyrrhenian pirates kidnapped the god off the west coast of what is now <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="italy">Italy</span>, Dionysus responds by having grapevines sprout all over the ship. Realizing they were in the presence of a god, the terrified pirates threw themselves into the sea. Rather than let them drown, Dionysus transformed the sailors into dolphins.</p>

            <h2>Performance and mysteries</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Worship of Dionysus was not uniform in the classic world. Some of it was public and organised, while other rituals were mysterious and carried out in secret. Many Greeks showed their reverence for Dionysus through festivals; in <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="rome">Rome</span>, where he was called <span class="epithet" about="dyonisus" id="mention-1" data-sort="bacchus">Bacchus</span>, these became the <span class="ritual" data-label="rituals" data-sort="bacchanalia" about="dyonisus">Bacchanalia</span>—wild rituals celebrated at night in forests and mountains. The <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-48" data-sort="maenads">maenads</span> would enter a delirious state of ecstasy, then— inspired by the personification of Dionysus in the form of a priest—dance wildly before setting out on a hunt.</p>

            <p>In the days that followed, ancient <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="greece">Greece</span>’s playwrights would present their works—tragedies, comedies, and satyric drama—and compete for top honors. (According to tradition, tragedy was originally related to songs from the Dionysian feast of the tragos, goat, and oidos, song). Actors who gave the best performances would also be awarded prizes. Those taking first place would be given wreaths of ivy, in a nod to the patron god of wine.</p>

            <h2>Outsider or Olympian?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>At first glance these mysteries, and the orgiastic rites that surrounded Dionysus, seem to run counter to the harmonious and ordered view of <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-10" data-sort="classical">classical</span> Greek religion. For this reason, many scholars, especially of the German tradition, for a long time did not believe that Dionysus could be truly <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="hellenic">Hellenic</span>. They considered him to be a foreign god, perhaps Thracian or Phrygian, and discounted the possibility that the myths around his death and resurrection could be Greek. Positivist scholars of the 19th century argued that Dionysus was an imported rather than a Greek god, and that the <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-48" data-sort="maenads">maenads</span> existed only in myth and literature.</p>

            </div>
            <p>These preconceptions changed over the course of the 20th century. In 1953, thanks to the decipherment of Linear B script—the writing system used by the <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-48" data-sort="mycenaean">Mycenaean</span> civilization, which predates the Greek alphabet by several centuries—researchers learned that Dionysus was indeed known in <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="greece" data-label="places">Greece</span> as far back as the 13th century B.C. Ancient <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-48" data-sort="mycenaean">Mycenaean</span> tablets found in the palace of <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-48" data-sort="pylos" data-label="places">Pylos</span>, in the <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-48" data-sort="peloponnese" data-label="places">Peloponnese</span> region of southern <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-48" data-sort="greece" data-label="places">Greece</span>, mention his name and prove that Dionysus was not a god adopted from abroad, but a profoundly Greek divinity.</p>
            <p>Evidence of the <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-48" data-sort="maenads">maenads</span> existence has been found as well, in Greek inscriptions from various time periods. Apparently there really were groups of women who would reach such a state of delirium, under the influence of Dionysus’ priestly incarnation, that they were prepared to rip apart live animals and eat their raw flesh.</p>

            <h2>Divine influence</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Dionysus was thus a fully Greek god, whose popularity has spanned different time periods and guises; he is depicted as both a beautifully effeminate, long-haired youth and a corpulent, bearded mature man. The Greek Dionysus and the Roman <span class="epithet" about="dyonisus" id="mention-1" data-sort="bacchus">Bacchus</span> are functionally the same god, but there are a few key differences. Dionysus—a noble, youthful figure in myth and <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-10" data-sort="classical">classical</span> literature—is usually listed alongside the 12 Olympian gods. <span class="epithet" about="dyonisus" id="mention-1" data-sort="bacchus">Bacchus</span>, on the other hand, is often seen as a portly older man who, according to the Roman poet <span class="person" about="ovid" id="mention-48" data-sort="ovid">Ovid</span>, could be vengeful, using his staff as both a magic wand and a weapon against those who dared oppose his cult and its ideals of freedom.</p>

            <p>Surveying different belief systems in the ancient world, it is easy to spot Dionysus’ influence in other traditions. The term “<span class="person" about="osiris" id="mention-48" data-sort="osiris">Osiris</span>-Dionysus” is used by some historians of religion to refer to a group of gods worshipped around the Mediterranean in the centuries prior to the emergence of <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-3" data-sort="christianity">Christianity</span>. These gods shared a number of characteristics, including being male, having divine fathers and mortal virgin mothers, and being reborn as gods.</p>

            <p>The Egyptian god <span class="person" about="osiris" id="mention-48" data-sort="osiris">Osiris</span>, for instance, was equated with Dionysus by the Greek historian <span class="person" about="herodotus" id="mention-49" data-sort="herodotus">Herodotus</span> during the fifth century B.C. By late antiquity, some gnostic and Neoplatonist philosophers had expanded the syncretic equation to include <span class="person" about="aion" id="mention-49" data-sort="aion">Aion</span>, <span class="person" about="adonis" id="mention-49" data-sort="adonis">Adonis</span>, and other gods of the mystery religions. Scholars also note links between the life-giving wine of the Dionysian cult and the centrality of wine in the <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-24" data-sort="christianity">Christian</span> Eucharist, as well as parallels between the Greek god and <span class="person" about="christ" id="mention-49" data-sort="christ">Christ</span> himself. The sixth-century B.C. <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-10" data-sort="classical">classical</span> cult known as <span class="ritual" data-label="cult" data-sort="orphism" about="dyonisus">Orphism</span> centered on the belief that Dionysus was torn to pieces and then resurrected. Twentieth-century thinkers such as James Frazer saw Dionysus and <span class="person" about="christ" id="mention-49" data-sort="christ">Christ</span> in the context of an eastern Mediterranean tradition of dying-and-rising gods, whose sacrifice and resurrection redeemed their people.</p>
            <p>Clearly Dionysus continues to cast a long shadow. Given the prevalence and power of wine and early ecstasy, it is no mystery why.</p>

This magnificent composition depicts a well-known episode from <span class="culture" about="dyonisus" id="mention-10" data-sort="classical">classical</span> mythology. After helping the Athenian prince <span class="person" about="theseus" id="mention-48" data-sort="theseus">Theseus</span> kill the monstrous <span class="person" about="minotaur" id="mention-48" data-sort="minotaur">Minotaur</span>, <span class="person" about="ariadne" id="mention-24" data-sort="ariadne">Ariadne</span>, daughter of King Minos of Crete, flees with him. <span class="person" about="theseus" id="mention-48" data-sort="theseus">Theseus</span> cruelly abandons her on <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-49" data-sort="naxos" data-label="places">the island of Naxos</span>, and she is devastated by his abandonment. <span class="person" about="ariadne" id="mention-24" data-sort="ariadne">Ariadne</span> falls asleep and is discovered by Dionysus, who arrives on <span class="place" about="dyonisus" id="mention-49" data-sort="naxos" data-label="places">Naxos</span> accompanied by his retinue. He immediately falls in love with her, and they marry. The decoration of the sarcophagus shows a band of <span class="person" about="satyrs" id="mention-48" data-sort="satyrs">satyrs</span> playing instruments and <span class="person" about="nymphs" id="mention-48" data-sort="maenads">maenads</span> dancing wildly. Centaurs appear as well, including a mother holding her little son in her arms. The episode is a fitting scene for a sarcophagus like this one, from the third century A.D.: There is a parallel between a deceased person’s hope for salvation after death and the immortality that Dionysus grants <span class="person" about="ariadne" id="mention-24" data-sort="ariadne">Ariadne</span>. Near the top of the facade is a human figure whose features are unfinished. It may have meant to be the deceased, whose features may also have supplied the likeness for the unfinished <span class="person" about="ariadne" id="mention-24" data-sort="ariadne">Ariadne</span>. Likewise, a central blank space at the top was possibly intended for an inscription.</p>
