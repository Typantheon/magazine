				<h2>Etimology</h2>
        <br>
				<p> Cailleach is a common word in both
				<span class = "languages" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-15" data-label="languages" data-sort = "scottish" > Scottish </span>
				and
				<span class = "languages" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-16" data-label="languages" data-sort = "irish-gaelic"> Irish Gaelic </span>
				meaning "old woman" or "hag".</p>
				<p>This current word was derived from "-caillech", a term meaning "Veiled one" in
				<span class = "languages" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-17" data-label="languages" data-sort = "old-gaelic"> Old Gaelic </span>.
				These terms stem from a base root shared with many others that describe women, such as "-caillin".</p>
				<p>Poets have given her different names across time:
				<span class="languages" about="alternatenames" id="mention-18" data-label="other-names" data-sort="Digdi, Milucra, Birog, Bui, Burach">
                        <ul>
				<li>Digdi (or Digde) </li>
				<li>Milucra</li>
                                <li>Birog (the fairy-woman who saved lugh of the long-arm as an infant)</li>
				<li>Bui (one of Lugh's wives)</li>
				<li> Burach</li>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </span>
			</p> 
				<p>Due to many of these being separate characters altogether, some scholars believe that Cailleach was more
				of a title than a name, that any old woman could be called a Cailleach.</p>
				<p>Her most prominent title was
				<span class = "epithet" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-18" data-label = "epithets" data-sort = "Cailleach - Bheara"> "Cailleach Bheara" </span>,
				revealing her as "master of winter". The many regions named for her often gave her unique titles
				reflective of their respective landscapes.</p>
				
        <p>Examples included "Chailleach Bheara" (the Hag of Beara) in
				<span class = "place" about="countycork" id = "mention-19" data-label ="place" data-sort="County-Cork" wikidata = "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162475"> County Cork</span>,
				Ireland, and the Storm Hag(s) in Scotland.</p>

				<h2> Attributes </h2>
				<p><span class = "physical des" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-20" data-label="physical description" data-sort="The Cailleach appears primarily as a veiled old woman, sometimes with only one eye. 
          Her skin was deathly pale or blue, while her teeth were red and her clothes adorned with skulls">
          The Cailleach appears primarily as a veiled old woman, sometimes with only one eye. 
          Her skin was deathly pale or blue, while her teeth were red and her clothes adorned with skulls. </span>
				<span class = "powers" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-21" data-label = "powers" data-sort="leap across mountains and ride storms">
          She could leap across mountains and ride storms. </span></p>
          <p>In the Manx tradition, the Cailleach was a shapeshifter capable of
				<span class = "powers" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-22" data-label = "powers" data-sort="shapeshifter">transforming into a giant bird</span>.
				  The Veiled one was a creator deity that shaped much of the known landscape; whether she did so
				  intentionally remains unclear.</p>
				  <p>Her tools of creation and destruction included her
				<span class="object" about="thecailleach" id="mention-23" data-label = "mythology" data-sort="hammer">hammer</span>,
				  with which she was able to control storms and thunder.
				  In some legends, she also controlled a
				<span class="object" about="thecailleach" id="mention-24" data-label = "mythology" data-sort="well"> well </span>
				  would occasionally overflow and flood the land.</p>
				  <p>The Cailleach was neither fully good nor fully evil; her intentions varied from tale to tale.
          Through her association with storms and thunder, she was a natural and wild destructive force. 
          Despite this, she also cared deeply for animals both wild and domestic during the dark winter months.
          In all three Gaelic-speaking regions, she was the patron of wolves emboldened by winter hunger; in Scotland, she also served as a
				<span class="domain"  about="thecailleach" id="mention-25" data-label="creatures" data-sort="deer"> deer</span>herder.
				  The Cailleach was both <span class = "physical des" about = "thecailleach" id = "mention-26" data-label="physical description" data-sort="ageless-and-immortal"> ageless and immortal</span>;
				  as winter gave way to spring, she would take a drought that returned her to youth.</p>
				  <p>In Manx legend, she spent half the year as a young woman and the other half as a old crone: she was only
				      known as the Cailleach during the latter half.
				      In Ireland, she had seven periods of youth, after which she remained old permanently.</p>
          <p>The seasonal division between summer and winterwhere the Cailleach ruled winter and Brigid ruled summer highlighted the association of the two goddesses.
              On <span class = "event" about = "samhain" id = "mention-27" data-label = "events" data-sort="samhain" wikidata = "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207365">Samhain</span>,
              or October 31st, the celtic year ends and winter begins, marking the return of the Cailleach.
				In Scotland and the Isle of Man, the Cailleach transforms into Brigid during
				<span class = "event" about = "beltane" id = "mention-28" data-label = "events" data-sort="beltane" wikidata = "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q792558Beltane">Beltane</span>,
              a fertility festival held on may 1st.</p>
				    <p>The Cailleach was also a goddess of
				    <span class="domain" about="thecailleach" id = "mention-29" data-label = "domains" data-sort="grain"> grain</span>,
				    a key resource in surviving winter. The last sheath of grain harvested was dedicated to her, and used to
				    begin the next planting season.
				    Like many Irish goddesses, the Cailleach was linked to sovereignty and rulership. Before anyone could
                    rule the land, they had to first garner her approval.</p>
			</div>

			<h2> Sites </h2>
			<p>
				One of the Cailleach's most remarkable attributes was her association with places.
				The Cailleach was tied to inhospitable locations across the Gaelic-speaking Celtic world. The Cailleach
				had more ties to local geography than any other celtic deity.
				Many locations have retained their Cailleach connections to this day. Such locations include:</p>
                <p>

						Scotland.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2> Family </h2>
			<p> The Cailleach had few explicit familial ties, the most well-known of which was the Bodach, a Scottish
				trickster spirit with whom she had many children.
				According to an
				<span class="literature" about="thecailleach" id="mention-41" data-label="poem" data-sort="old-irish-poem">old Irish poem</span>,
				she was a maiden seven times, allowing her to have many children by many husbands, as well as countless
				foster-children.
				By the time her final period of youth had ended, she had outlived her husbands and children alike, and
				was said to be the maternal ancestor of every Irish man and tribe.</p>

			<h2> Mythology </h2>
			<p>
				While many of the Cailleach's myths have faded from memory, a number of rituals and traditions still
				exist. </p>

			<h3><span class="ritual" about="thecailleach" id="mention-42" data-label="mythology" data-sort="Collecting-firewood">Collecting firewood </h3>
				<p>On <span class="event" about="firewood ritual" id="mention-43" data-label ="events" data-sort="Imbolc" wikidata ="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q376333">Imbolc</span>,
				or February 1st, of each year, the Cailleach runs out of firewood for the winter.
				In the Manx tradition, she transforms into a great bird and collects firewood in her beak. In Ireland and
				Scotland, meanwhile, she collects firewood as an old woman.
				If she wishes for winter to last longer, she makes the day sunny and bright for her search. If she
				accidentally oversleeps, the day is stormy and gray.
				Thus, tradition holds that if February 1st is gray and wintery, winter will be shorter that year; if the day
				is bright, winter will return due to her preparation.
				In the <span class="place" about="firewood" id="mention-44" data-label="place" data-sort="United States" wikidata= "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30">United States</span>,
				this tradition was transformed into
			<span class="event" about="firewood" id="mention-45" data-label="events" data-sort= "Groundhog-day">Groundhog Day</span>, removing the Cailleach while retaining the central ritual.</p>
			</span>
			<br>

			<h3><span class="ritual" about="thecailleach" id="mention-46" data-label="events" data-sort="Tigh-nan-cailleach"> Tigh Nan Cailleach </h3>
                    <p>The Cailleach, the Bodach, and their children appeared to the people of Glen Lyon and Glen Cailleach seeking shelter. 
                    Despite their fearsome reputations (or perhaps because of them), the family was granted shelter. 
                    During this period, the surrounding glens became incredibly fertile. Before departing the area, the cailleach gave the people a parting gift: the
                    area would be eternally fertile, provided that they put up stones for her family between May 1st and October 31st, from Beltane to Samhain.
                        Each year, this ritual is repeated.</p></span>

			<h2> Literature </h2>
			<blockquote> The Maidens rejoice

			</blockquote>
			<p> The Cailleach has appeared in literature throughout the ages.
				In the 8th century poem, Lament of the Old woman, she reflects on her faded youth and laments its loss.
				In <span class = "connections" about="thecailleach" id="mention-48" data-label="writer"

				20th century retelling of Scottish folklore, the Cailleach became "Beira", queen of winter.
				The work retained much of the Cailleach's classic characterization and, along with Lady Gregory's
				translation of old Irish tales, served as one of the
				more prominent sources of cailleach myths. </p>

			<h2> Other Mythology </h2>
			<p>The Cailleach was unique among celtic deities, only appearing in Gaelic-speaking regions namely, Ireland,
			Scotland, and the Isle of Man.
			While Brythonic Celtic regions told stories involving similar hags, none of these characters could rival the
                consistency the Cailleach.</p>
			<p>Such hags included
			<span class = "connections" about = "black annis" id = "mention-49" data-label = "creatures" data-sort = "Black annis" wikidata = "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q475204">Black Annis</span>,
			a blue-faced hag of Leicester with iron claws who supped on children.
			These hags were often closer to the popular notion of a hag, rather than the more capricious Cailleach.</p>
             <p>
                Outside of the Celtic world, the Cailleach has numerous similarities based on her individual attributes.
                As a creator deity, she bore similarities to the greco-roman
			<span class = "connections" about = "gaia" id = "mention-50" data-label = "gods" data-sort = "Gaia" wikidata ="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93172">Gaia</span>.
			The Cailleach was also remarkably similar to the Norse deity
			<span class = "connections" about = "skadi" id = "mention-51" data-label = "gods" data-sort = "Skadi" wikidata ="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q244032">Skadi</span>,
			the goddess of winter and darkness,
			as well as the germanic
			<span class = "connections" about = "holle" id = "mention-52" data-label = "gods" data-sort = "Holle" wikidata ="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17076208">Holle</span>,
			wife of
			<span class = "connections" about = "odin" id = "mention-53" data-label = "gods" data-sort = "Odin" wikidata ="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43610">Wotan (Odin)</span>
			and master of winter's cold.
			Though her stormy hammer closely resembled
			<span class = "connections" about = "thor" id = "mention-54" data-label = "gods" data-sort = "Thor" wikidata ="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42952">Thor</span>'s
			hammer Mjolnir, the Cailleach's behavior and appearance were closer to that of Thor's foes,
			the
			<span class = "connections" about = "jotunn" id = "mention-55" data-label = "giants" data-sort = "Jotunn">frost giants</span>.
			In

			carried many of the attributes of the Cailleach.
			An impossibly old woman just as likely to help as hinder, Baba Yaga made many appearances in Slavic
			folklore.
			Her leaping chicken-legged hut moved in much the same way the Cailleach did when she traveled between
                mountains.</p>
