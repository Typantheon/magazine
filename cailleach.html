		<h3>Keyconcepts</h3>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li> Was the Cailleach an evil deity? </li>
			<p><span class="morality" about="thecailleach" id="mention-8" data-label="morality"> The Cailleach had many
					different attributes, some benevolent and some fearsome, and due to that she wasnt considered solely
					good or evil.</span>
			</p>
			<li> How was the Cailleach linked to the goddess Brigid? </li>
			<p> The Cailleach and
				<span class="connections" about="brigid" id="mention-9" data-label="gods"
					wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q255459"> Brigid </span>
				shared their rule throughout the year, with Brigid reigning during the summer and the Cailleach
				holding sway throughout winter.
			</p>
			<li> Did the Cailleach ever marry? </li>
			<p> The Cailleach was married numerous times, but the best-known of her husbands was the
				<span class="family" about="thebodach" id="mention-10" data-label="gods"
					wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q615532"> Bodach</span>,
				with whom she had many children.
			</p>
		</ul>
		<p>
			One of the great Celtic ancestors, the Cailleach was the goddess of the cold and the winds.
			<br>
			Sometimes known as the "Veiled one" or the
			<span class="epithet" about="thecailleach" id="mention-11" data-label="epithet"> Queen of winter"</span>,
			the Cailleach determined the winters length and harshness.
			As both "divine hag" and "creator deity", she remains a popular topic for poets and writers.
			<br>
			The Cailleach dwelled in
			<span class="place" about="Scotland" id="mention-12" data-label="place"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22"> Scotland</span>,
			<span class="place" about="Ireland" id="mention-13" data-label="place"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q22890"> Ireland</span>,
			and the
			<span class="place" about="Isle of Man" id="mention-14" data-label="place"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9676"> Isle of Man </span>
			and many places remain dedicated to her within these regions.
		</p>

		<h3>Etimology</h3>
		<br>
		<p> Cailleach is a common word in both
			<span class="language" about="thecailleach" id="mention-15" data-label="scottish"> Scottish </span>
			and
			<span class="language" about="thecailleach" id="mention-16" data-label="irish-gaelic"> Irish Gaelic </span>
			meaning "old woman" or "hag".
		</p>
		<p>This current word was derived from "-caillech", a term meaning "Veiled one" in
			<span class="language" about="thecailleach" id="mention-17" data-label="old-gaelic"> Old Gaelic </span>.
			These terms stem from a base root shared with many others that describe women, such as "-caillin".
		</p>
		<p>Poets have given her different names across time:
			<span class="language" about="alternatenames" id="mention-18" data-label="other-names">
				<ul>
					<li>Digdi (or Digde),
					<li>Milucra,
					<li>Birog (the fairy-woman who saved lugh of the long-arm as an infant),
					<li>Bui (one of Lughs wives), and Burach.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>Due to many of these being separate characters altogether, some scholars believe that Cailleach was more
			of a title than a name, that any old woman could be called a Cailleach.</p>
		<p>Her most prominent title was
			<span class="epithet" about="thecailleach" id="mention-18" data-label="cailleach bheara"
				data-sorts="epithets"> "Cailleach Bheara" </span>,
			revealing her as "master of winter". The many regions named for her often gave her unique titles
			reflective of their respective landscapes.
		</p>

		<p>Examples included "Chailleach Bheara" (the Hag of Beara) in
			<span class="place" about="countycork" id="mention-19" data-label="county cork"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q162475"> County Cork</span>,
			Ireland, and the Storm Hag(s) in Scotland.

			<h3> Attributes </h3>
			<p><span class="physical des" about="thecailleach" id="mention-20" data-label="physical description">
					The Cailleach appears primarily as a veiled old woman, sometimes with only one eye.
					Her skin was deathly pale or blue, while her teeth were red and her clothes adorned with skulls.
				</span>
				<span class="powers" about="thecailleach" id="mention-21" data-label="powers">
					She could leap across mountains and ride storms. </span>
			</p>
			<p>In the Manx tradition, the Cailleach was a shapeshifter capable of
				<span class="powers" about="thecailleach" id="mention-22" data-label="powers">transforming into a giant
					bird</span>.
				The Veiled one was a creator deity that shaped much of the known landscape; whether she did so
				intentionally remains unclear.
			</p>
			<p>Her tools of creation and destruction included her
				<span class="object" about="thecailleach" id="mention-23" data-label="mythology"> hammer</span>,
				with which she was able to control storms and thunder.
				In some legends, she also controlled a
				<span class="object" about="thecailleach" id="mention-24" data-label="mythology"> well </span>
				would occasionally overflow and flood the land.
			</p>
			<p>The Cailleach was neither fully good nor fully evil; her intentions varied from tale to tale.
				Through her association with storms and thunder, she was a natural and wild destructive force.
				Despite this, she also cared deeply for animals both wild and domestic during the dark winter months.
				In all three Gaelic-speaking regions, she was the patron of wolves emboldened by winter hunger; in
				Scotland, she also served as a
				<span class="domain" about="thecailleach" id="mention-25" data-label="creatures"> deer</span>herder.
				The Cailleach was both <span class="physical des" about="thecailleach" id="mention-26"
					data-label="physical description"> ageless and immortal</span>;
				as winter gave way to spring, she would take a drought that returned her to youth.
			</p>
			<p>In Manx legend, she spent half the year as a young woman and the other half as a old crone: she was only
				known as the Cailleach during the latter half.
				In Ireland, she had seven periods of youth, after which she remained old permanently.</p>
			<p>The seasonal division between summer and winterwhere the Cailleach ruled winter and Brigid ruled summer
				highlighted the association of the two goddesses.
				On <span class="events" about="samhain" id="mention-27" data-label="events"
					wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207365">Samhain</span>,
				or October 31st, the celtic year ends and winter begins, marking the return of the Cailleach.
				In Scotland and the Isle of Man, the Cailleach transforms into Brigid during
				<span class="events" about="beltane" id="mention-28" data-label="events"
					wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q792558Beltane">Beltane</span>,
				a fertility festival held on may 1st.
			</p>
			<p>The Cailleach was also a goddess of
				<span class="domain" about="thecailleach" id="mention-29" data-label="domains"> grain</span>,
				a key resource in surviving winter. The last sheath of grain harvested was dedicated to her, and used to
				begin the next planting season.
				Like many Irish goddesses, the Cailleach was linked to sovereignty and rulership. Before anyone could
				rule the land, they had to first garner her approval.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3> Sites </h3>
		<p>
			One of the Cailleach's most remarkable attributes was her association with places.
			The Cailleach was tied to inhospitable locations across the Gaelic-speaking Celtic world. The Cailleach
			had more ties to local geography than any other celtic deity.
			Many locations have retained their Cailleach connections to this day. Such locations include:</p>

		<br>

		<h3> Family </h3>
		<p> The Cailleach had few explicit familial ties, the most well-known of which was the Bodach, a Scottish
			trickster spirit with whom she had many children.
			According to an
			<span class="literature" about="thecailleach" id="mention-41" data-label="poem" data-sort="literature">old
				Irish poem</span>,
			she was a maiden seven times, allowing her to have many children by many husbands, as well as countless
			foster-children.
			By the time her final period of youth had ended, she had outlived her husbands and children alike, and
			was said to be the maternal ancestor of every Irish man and tribe.

		<h3> Mythology </h3>
		<p>
			While many of the Cailleach's myths have faded from memory, a number of rituals and traditions still
			exist. </p>

		<h4><span class="ritual" about="thecailleach" id="mention-42" data-label="firewood"
				data-sort="ritual">Collecting firewood </h4>
		<p>On <span class="events" about="firewood ritual" id="mention-43" data-label="imbolc" data-sort="celebrations"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q376333">Imbolc</span>,
			or February 1st, of each year, the Cailleach runs out of firewood for the winter.
			In the Manx tradition, she transforms into a great bird and collects firewood in her beak. In Ireland and
			Scotland, meanwhile, she collects firewood as an old woman.
			If she wishes for winter to last longer, she makes the day sunny and bright for her search. If she
			accidentally oversleeps, the day is stormy and gray.
			Thus, tradition holds that if February 1st is gray and wintery, winter will be shorter that year; if the day
			is bright, winter will return due to her preparation.
			In the <span class="place" about="firewood" id="mention-44" data-label="United States"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30">United States</span>,
			this tradition was transformed into
			<span class="events" about="firewood" id="mention-45" data-label="groundhog-day"
				data-sort="celebrations">Groundhog Day</span>, removing the Cailleach while retaining the central
			ritual.
		</p>
		</span>
		<br>

		<h4><span class="ritual" about="thecailleach" id="mention-46" data-label="tigh nan cailleach"
				data-sort="ritual"> Tigh Nan Cailleach </h4>
		<p>The Cailleach, the Bodach, and their children appeared to the people of Glen Lyon and Glen Cailleach seeking
			shelter.
			Despite their fearsome reputations (or perhaps because of them), the family was granted shelter.
			During this period, the surrounding glens became incredibly fertile. Before departing the area, the
			cailleach gave the people a parting gift: the
			area would be eternally fertile, provided that they put up stones for her family between May 1st and October
			31st, from Beltane to Samhain.
			Each year, this ritual is repeated.</p>

		<h3> Literature </h3>
		<blockquote> The Maidens rejoice
			<br>
			When May-Day comes to them;
			<br>
			For me sorrow is meeter,
			<br>
			I am wretched, I am an old hag.
			<br>
			- Lament of the Hag of Beara, trans. <p class="literature" about="lamentofthehagofbeara" id="mention-47"
				data-label="augusta lady gregory" data-sort="literature"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q239540">Lady Gregory</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p> The Cailleach has appeared in literature throughout the ages.
			In the 8th century poem, Lament of the Old woman, she reflects on her faded youth and laments its loss.
			In <span class="literature" about="thecailleach" id="mention-48" data-label="donald alexander mackenzie"
				data-sort="literature" wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5293962">Donald Alexander
				Mackenzie</span>'s
			20th century retelling of Scottish folklore, the Cailleach became "Beira", queen of winter.
			The work retained much of the Cailleach's classic characterization and, along with Lady Gregory's
			translation of old Irish tales, served as one of the
			more prominent sources of cailleach myths. </p>

		<br>

		<h3> Other Mythology </h3>
		<p>The Cailleach was unique among celtic deities, only appearing in Gaelic-speaking regions namely, Ireland,
			Scotland, and the Isle of Man.
			While Brythonic Celtic regions told stories involving similar hags, none of these characters could rival the
			consistency the Cailleach.</p>
		<p>Such hags included
			<span class="connections" about="black annis" id="mention-49" data-label="black annis"
				data-sort="connections" wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q475204">Black Annis</span>,
			a blue-faced hag of Leicester with iron claws who supped on children.
			These hags were often closer to the popular notion of a hag, rather than the more capricious Cailleach.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of the Celtic world, the Cailleach has numerous similarities based on her individual attributes.
			As a creator deity, she bore similarities to the greco-roman
			<span class="connections" about="gaia" id="mention-50" data-label="gaia" data-sort="connections"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q93172">Gaia</span>.
			The Cailleach was also remarkably similar to the Norse deity
			<span class="connections" about="skadi" id="mention-51" data-label="skadi" data-sort="connections"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q244032">Skadi</span>,
			the goddess of winter and darkness,
			as well as the germanic
			<span class="connections" about="holle" id="mention-52" data-label="holle" data-sort="connections"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17076208">Holle</span>,
			wife of
			<span class="connections" about="odin" id="mention-53" data-label="odin" data-sort="connections"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q43610">Wotan (Odin)</span>
			and master of winter's cold.
			Though her stormy hammer closely resembled
			<span class="connections" about="thor" id="mention-54" data-label="thor" data-sort="connections"
				wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42952">Thor</span>'s
			hammer Mjolnir, the Cailleach's behavior and appearance were closer to that of Thor's foes,
			the
			<span class="connections" about="frostgiant" id="mention-55" data-label="frostgiant"
				data-sort="connections">frost giants</span>.
			In
			<span class="culture" about="babayaga" id="mention-56" data-label="slavic">Slavic mythology, <span
					class="connections" about="babayaga" id="mention-57" data-label="babayaga" data-sort="connections"
					wikidata="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q187002">Baba Yaga</span>
				carried many of the attributes of the Cailleach.
				An impossibly old woman just as likely to help as hinder, Baba Yaga made many appearances in Slavic
				folklore.
				Her leaping chicken-legged hut moved in much the same way the Cailleach did when she traveled between
				mountains.

		<h3> Pop Culture </h3>
		<p> The cailleach has appeared in multiple pieces of popular culture, including:

		<ul>
			<li> In
				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-58" data-label="game">Dungeons &
					Dragons</span>
				a bheur hag took the Cailleachs name and appearance as a blue-skinned, winter-based hag;
			<li> In the fantasy television series
				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-59" data-label="tv-series">Merlin</span>,
				the Cailleach appeared when Morgana broke the veil between living and dead.
				She demanded a sacrifice in exchange for returning the Dorocha to the land of the dead, and
				though Arthur and Merlin offered themselves, Lancelot gave himself instead;
			<li> The band
				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-60" data-label="band">Crown of Asteria</span>

				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-61" data-label="music">"Cailleach: Crone
					Moon" on their album "Crone"</span>;
			<li> A
				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-62" data-label="cinema">short film</span>,
				written and directed by Rosie Reed Hillman, told the story of Morag, an old woman in love with
				life on the edge of civilization in the Scottish western isles.
				The character, who wore a hood like a veil, bore more than a few similarities to the Cailleach;
			<li> The Cailleach has appeared in a number of video games. She made an in-name only appearance in
				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-63" data-label="game"> Final Fantasy
					XI</span>,
				and appeared as a demon in the
				<span class="pop-culture" about="thecailleach" id="mention-64" data-label="game">Megami Tensei
					series</span>,
				most notably Shin Megami Tensei II;
			<li> An analysis of the archetypical wise woman healer that appeared in Ireland's oral traditions
				can be found in <span class="literature" about="thecailleach" id="mention-65" data-label="book">"Gearoid
					O Crualaoichs, Book of the Cailleach: Stories of the Wise Woman Healer"</span>.
