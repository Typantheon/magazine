        <p>While Hephaestus resided among the gods as an artisan and trap-setter, he nevertheless often found himself
            unloved and unwanted by the other gods. In his mythology, Hephaestus was mistreated and rejected by many of
            the gods, including his mother, Hera, his wife, Aphrodite, and the supremely powerful Zeus. But Hephaestus
            could also hold his own among the Olympians, and he usually found creative ways to get back at his abusers.

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>As with many Greek deities, there is no reliable etymology for the name “Hephaestus.” The first known
            recording of the name (or a form of it) is in an inscription on the palace at <span class="place"
                about="hephaestus" id="mention-8" data-label="athens" data-sort="places">Athens</span> and on the <span
                class="place" about="hephaestus" id="mention-9" data-label="knossos" data-sort="places">Knossos</span>
            on <span class="place" about="hephaestus" id="mention-10" data-label="crete"
                data-sort="places">Crete</span>, where it appears as a-pa-i-ti-jo in the syllabic Linear B script used
            in Bronze Age Greece (ca. 1600–1100 BCE).</p>
        <p>The palace at Knossos was a relic of the Minoan people who lived more than a thousand years before the Greek
            classical period (490–323 BCE), indicating that the word was present in early Greek society. However,
            scholars have generally interpreted the name that appears on this inscription as theophoric—that is, as a
            name that contains the name of the god, rather than the name of the god itself (similar to later Greek names
            such as Hephaestion).</p>
        <p>Today, the etymology of Hephaestus’ name is usually thought to have been pre-Greek.</p>

        <h3>Other Names</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus’ Roman counterpart was called Vulcan.</p>
        <h3>Epithets</h3>
        <p>Many of Hephaestus’ epithets referred to his physical appearance or his lameness, such as amphigyeis (“the
            lame one”) and kyllopodiōn (“foot-dragging”). Other epithets were more positive, emphasizing Hephaestus’
            skills as a craftsman and smith. These epithets included klytotechnēs (“famous artificer”), polymētis
            (“shrewd”), and chalkeus (“bronze-working”).</p>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Domains</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus was the god of crafts of all kinds, especially metalworking. He was also the god of fire, and his
            workshop was said to be located (appropriately) beneath a volcano.</p>
        <h3>Iconography</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus was usually depicted as a burly man, either bearded or unbearded. Due to his lameness, he lacked
            the physical perfection of the other Olympians, and there are artistic representations that call attention
            to his crippled legs. In art, Hephaestus was generally dressed simply, in a tunic and a cap called a pilos.
            He was distinguished by his attributes, the tools of his trade: an ax, double hammer, tongs, bellows, and
            firebrands.</p>

                right hand. Hephaestus was rarely depicted in statuary form in the ancient world.<br>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM

        </figure>
        <p>Though somewhat removed from the other gods, Hephaestus did have an entourage of his own, consisting of the
            giant, one-eyed Cyclopes, who served as his helpers at his workshop. The god was sometimes also shown riding
            atop a donkey.</p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>While it is known that Hephaestus was the son of Hera, the rest of his origin remains cloudy due to
            differences in the stories of his conception and birth. According to the Homeric epics, the earliest Greek
            literary texts, Hephaestus’ father was Zeus.3 But according to Hesiod, the second of the great Greek epic
            poets, Hephaestus did not have a father at all: Hera, says Hesiod, became angry with Zeus when he gave birth
            to Athena without her and determined to have a child of her own without Zeus.</p>
        <p>According to the most familiar tradition, Hephaestus married Aphrodite, the goddess of love and sex. But in
            the Iliad, Homer calls Hephaestus’ wife Charis,5 and in the Theogony, Hesiod calls her Aglaea.</p>
        <p>Although Hephaestus was not as desirable as his brethren gods, he did reproduce. By far his most important
            child was Erichthonius, who was born when Hephaestus attempted to rape Athena but ended up spilling his seed
            on the earth. Erichthonius would grow up to become the founding hero of the great city of Athens.</p>
        <p>Another son of Hephaestus was Periphetes, known as the “Club Wielder,” a beastly man with one eye and a lame
            leg like his father. He lurked on the roads near Athens, robbing travelers, until the mortal hero Theseus
            slayed him.</p>
        <p>In some traditions, Hephaestus also fathered Palaemon, one of the Argonauts who sailed with Jason to fetch
            the Golden Fleece.</p>
        <p>Hephaestus had a handful of other children with other goddesses and mortal women, but none with Aphrodite.

        <h2>Mythology</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Birth and Expulsion</h3>
        <p>A central aspect of the Hephaestus mythos—and one often depicted in both ancient and modern art—was his
            expulsion from Olympus, as well as his eventual return. This story saw two main variations:</p>
        <p>1. After Hephaestus was born, his mother, Hera, was disgusted when she found out that the child had a
            malformed foot. Deeming Hephaestus unworthy of divinity, Hera threw him down to earth. After his fall,
            however, Hephaestus was discovered by the Nereid Thetis and some of her sisters, who kindly nursed him back
            to health.</p>
        <p>2. In another story, it was Zeus who cast Hephaestus out of heaven because the lame god had tried to come to
            his mother’s assistance after she angered Zeus. Hephaestus fell for a full day before landing on the island
            of Lemnos (this spot, the “Lemnian earth,” became a sacred site for pilgrims of Hephaestus, who claimed that
            it possessed healing powers). This time, it was the Sintian people who helped Hephaestus.</p>
        <p>These may or may not have been multiple variants of a single myth. Both of them, interestingly, feature in
            Homer’s Iliad: there, the first fall is said to have taken place right after Hephaestus was born, while the
            second took place when he was already fully grown.</p>
        <p>Yet some sources combine the versions, or make them into mutually incompatible alternatives: the mythographer
            Apollodorus, for example, writes that Hephaestus was cast out of heaven by Zeus for trying to help his
            mother, Hera (as in the second account) and that he was saved by Thetis (as in the first account). He then
            goes on to say that Hephaestus only became crippled as a result of his fall; this would imply that the first
            fall of Hephaestus—when he was thrown out of heaven because of his lame, malformed feet—could not have
            happened.</p>
        <h3>The Return of Hephaestus</h3>
        <p>Either way, Hephaestus was understandably troubled by the incident and refused to return to Olympus. To
            avenge himself (based on the first account), Hephaestus built a trap for Hera—a chair with a secret
            mechanism. Once Hera sat on the chair, it locked her in place.</p>
        <p>For some time, Hephaestus wandered the earth and refused to release Hera from the chair. He eventually
            returned to his proper place on Olympus, albeit not by his own volition. According to most stories,
            Hephaestus was wined by Dionysus, who gave him enough of his vineyard’s finest to ensure that he slept
            soundly; once Hephaestus was resting peacefully, the wine god placed him on a donkey that carried him to the
            top of Mount Olympus. Once there, he finally consented to release his mother and forgive her.</p>

                was depicted often on pottery made in Attica and Corinth.<br>WALTERS ART MUSEUM / CC0</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In other traditions, however, Hephaestus trapped Hera on the chair because, having been cast out of Olympus
            as an infant, he did not know who his parents were. As soon as Hera revealed that she was his mother,
            Hephaestus let her go.</p>
        <h3>Hephaestus, the Craftsman</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus was not usually the center of myths; he seldom figured as the hero in dramatic tales, took fewer
            lovers than his brothers and sisters, and was less conspicuous overall. Unlike most of the other gods, he
            was often a ridiculous or comedic figure, in part because of his disability.</p>
        <p>But Hephaestus was not to be underestimated. He was cunning and vengeful, often earning small victories. Such
            triumphs came from his tremendous skill as an artisan and his ability to contrive clever traps and tricks.
            Hephaestus’ masterful skill and ingenuity resulted in the creation of almost everything unique or
            sophisticated in Greek mythology.</p>
        <p>Hephaestus ran a massive workshop on Mount Olympus, complete with twenty bellows, a forge, and an anvil.
            Hephaestus also boasted a retinue of assistants, including not only several Cyclopes but also automata,
            which the clever god had crafted himself. Homer described these marvelous creations in the Iliad as
            “handmaidens wrought of gold in the semblance of living maids. In them is understanding in their hearts, and
            in them speech and strength, and they know cunning handiwork by gift of the immortal gods.”</p>
        <p>In later traditions, Hephaestus also had workshops in other, even more exotic locations. Some sources, for
            example, placed Hephaestus’ workshop at or near the volcanic Mount Etna in Sicily.15 Others placed the
            workshop on the island of Lemnos, said to be especially sacred to Hephaestus.</p>
        <p>Hephaestus fashioned countless beautiful things for gods, kings, and heroes, including palaces, temples,
            statues, armor and weapons, and jewelry. Among his most famous creations were aegis (the mighty shield used
            by Zeus and Athena);17 the necklace of Harmonia, sometimes said to curse whoever wore it (this was
            Hephaestus’ revenge on his wife, Aphrodite, who produced Harmonia through her adulterous affair with
            Ares);18 and the armor of various heroes, including Heracles,19 Achilles,20 and Aeneas.</p>
        <h3>Aphrodite and Ares</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus married Aphrodite, the most beautiful of all the goddesses, but their marriage was an unhappy one.
            In a famous scene from the Odyssey, a blind poet named Demodocus sings of how Hephaestus discovered that his
            wife was having an affair with Ares, the god of war.</p>
        <p>Hephaestus, the story goes, hatched a plan to catch Aphrodite and Ares in the act. He went to his workshop
            and created a net so fine that it could not be seen by the naked eye. He then placed the net over his bed;
            when Aphrodite and Ares, thinking Hephaestus was away, went to Hephaestus’ bed to have sex, Hephaestus
            trapped them in the net and called all the gods over to look upon the ridiculous scene.</p>
        <figure><img

        </figure>
        <p>“Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep,” says Homer’s Hephaestus, complaining about his cheating wife,
            “but the snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I
            gave him for the sake of his shameless girl; for his daughter is fair but bridles not her passion.”</p>
        <p>All the gods laughed heartily at the scene—all except Poseidon, the god of the sea, who insisted that
            Hephaestus let Ares and Aphrodite go. Hephaestus finally agreed; released from Hephaestus’ adamantine net,
            Ares and Aphrodite both fled the scene, ashamed.</p>
        <p>With this colorful depiction of their relationship in mind, it was unsurprising that Hephaestus and Aphrodite
            had no children together.</p>
        <h3>Athena and Athens</h3>
        <p>In another important myth, Hephaestus played a key role in the foundation of Athens. It began when Hephaestus
            first took an interest in Athena. Hephaestus and Athena, incidentally, were often viewed as counterpart
            deities. Both were creators and benefactors who brought the gifts of wisdom, creativity, and craft to
            humankind.</p>
        <p>According to one version of the story, Hephaestus attempted to rape Athena, but she eluded him just as he was
            about to consummate the act, causing him to ejaculate on the ground. His spilled semen impregnated Gaia, and
            out of the earth sprang Erichthonius, a prince raised by Athena who would become an early ruler of Athens.

        </figure>
        <p>In another (less familiar) version, Hephaestus earned Athena’s hand in marriage because he had, in a sense,
            helped to deliver her; he had done so by splitting Zeus’ head open as she began to emerge from it. While
            Zeus gave his blessing to Hephaestus, Athena remained reluctant. In the marriage bed, when Hephaestus was
            about to consummate the marriage, Athena lost her nerve and fled, causing Hephaestus to ejaculate upon the
            earth. In this version as well, Hephaestus’ spilled seed gave rise to Erichthonius.</p>
        <p>Whatever the exact details, Hephaestus’ child Erichthonius went on to become one of the founding figures of
            the great city of Athens. Like many children born from the earth, Erichthonius was sometimes depicted as
            having serpent features, though he was still regarded as a great king and the ancestor of the Athenian
            people.</p>
        <h3>Hephaestus and the Trojan War</h3>
        <p>According to the Iliad, it was Hephaestus who made Achilles a new set of armor when his previous set was
            stripped from the corpse of Patroclus by the Trojan hero Hector. (Achilles’ friend Patroclus had donned the
            awe-inspiring armor in a fatal effort to scare the Trojans away from the Greek camp.) The shield was
            particularly magnificent, decorated with elaborate scenes illustrating every facet of human life; it is
            described in detail by Homer.</p>
        <p>Later, Hephaestus helped Achilles fight off the river god Scamander. Achilles was on a rampage, killing
            countless Trojan warriors and throwing their corpses into the Scamander River. The river god, choking on
            bodies and blood, tried to drown Achilles in his rushing waters. The great hero might have perished then and
            there if Hera had not sent Hephaestus to help him. Hephaestus threatened to scorch Scamander and his river
            with fire if he did not leave Achilles alone; Scamander immediately did as he was asked</p>
        <h3>Other Myths</h3>
        <p>Hephaestus featured in a handful of other myths. In the terrible war between the Olympian gods and the
            so-called Giants (monsters born to the primordial earth goddess Gaia), Hephaestus killed the Giant called
            Mimas.</p>
        <p>In another important (and deeply misogynistic) myth—recounted by Hesiod in two different poems29—Zeus sought
            to punish humanity for the theft of fire by presenting them with the first woman. This woman was designed to
            unleash every conceivable evil on humanity and was, ironically, named Pandora (“all-gifted”). Naturally, it
            was the skilled craftsman Hephaestus who was tasked with creating Pandora.</p>
        <h2>Worship</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Festivals</h3>
        <p>The most well-known ancient festivals of Hephaestus were celebrated in Athens, where, as the father of the
            founding hero Erichthonius, he was especially revered. The Hephaestia, celebrated every four years, involved
            a torch race and sacrifices to the god.30 In another festival, the Chalkeia, craftsmen walked in a
            procession through the city in honor of Hephaestus and his counterpart Athena.</p>
        <p>In different parts of the Greek world, Hephaestus was also connected with the mystery cult of the Cabiri
            (whom he was said to have fathered).32 These mysteries most likely involved initiation rites, feasting, and
            sacrifices; they were practiced primarily in Asia Minor, Macedonia, Boeotia, and some northeastern Aegean
            islands.</p>
        <h3>Temples</h3>
        <p>The public cult of Hephaestus was not as widespread in Greece as that of most of the other Olympians.
            Hephaestus did, however, have important cult centers at Lemnos, an Aegean island that was especially sacred
            to him, and Athens, where he was worshipped together with Athena as one of the city’s chief patron gods.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>At Lemnos, the spot where Hephaestus supposedly landed when he was thrown from heaven was an especially
            sacred site. It was believed that this spot could cure various ailments, including snake bites.</p>
        <p>There was a large temple of Hephaestus, called the Theseium, near the agora of Athens; in it, the cult statue
            of Hephaestus stood next to that of Athena.</p>
        <p>Hephaestus also had a handful of temples in Sicily, where he was sometimes said to have had a workshop.</p>
        <h2>Pop Culture</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hephaestus has enjoyed a lively presence in popular media. In films and television based on Greek mythology,
            he usually appears as a powerful, thick-armed craftsman in the archetypal blacksmith mode. In the 1981 film
            Clash of the Titans, he was played by the large British wrestler Pat Roach. In the television series
            Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, meanwhile, he appeared as a large, leather-clad
            blacksmith played by actors Julian Garner and James Hoyte.</p>
        <p>In video games, too, Hephaestus is a renowned crafter of items. In the God of War series, he makes weapons
            for the protagonist, Kratos. In the classic video game Diablo II, a crazed blacksmith and dungeon master is
            named Hephaesto in a clear homage to the Greek deity.</p>
        <p>Finally, Hephaestus plays a role in the popular Percy Jackson and the Olympians book series by Rick Riordan—a
            series that has reignited interest in Greek mythology. In the fourth book, The Battle of the Labyrinth,
            Hephaestus appears as the master of the kiln, with a workshop that pumps out finely-tuned objects. Because
            the novel is a modern retelling, however, his most notable act is repairing an old Toyota that had broken
            down.</p>

            <li>Hesiod: Hephaestus’ genealogy and mythology are described in the seventh-century BCE epics of Hesiod,
                including the Theogony and the Works and Days. In the Shield of Heracles (traditionally, but dubiously,

                does play a role in Olympian Ode 7 as Zeus’ “midwife” during the birth of Athena.</li>
            <li>Aeschylus: In the tragedy Prometheus Bound (a fifth-century BCE tragedy that may or may not have
                actually been written by Aeschylus), it is Hephaestus who chains Prometheus to the mountain where his
                punishment for stealing the gods’ fire is to take place.</li>
            <li>Apollonius of Rhodes: There are references to the famous workshop of Hephaestus in Book 4 of the
                third-century BCE epic Argonautica, which tells the story of Jason and the Argonauts.</li>
            <li>Callimachus: In the third Hymn, dedicated to Artemis, it is Hephaestus who gives Artemis her weapons.
            </li>
            <li>Orphic Hymns: The Orphics were a Greek cult that believed a blissful afterlife could be attained by
                living an ascetic life. Orphic Hymn 65 (third century BCE to second century CE) is dedicated to
                Hephaestus.</li>
            <li>Strabo, Geography: A late first-century BCE geographical treatise and an important source for many local
                Greek myths, institutions, and religious practices from antiquity.</li>
            <li>Lucian: Hephaestus features in Lucian’s satirical Dialogues of the Gods (late first to early second
                century CE).</li>
            <li>Pausanias, Description of Greece: A second-century CE travelogue; like Strabo’s Geography, an important
                source for local myths and customs.</li>
            <li>Quintus of Smyrna: In the fourth-century CE epic Posthomerica, as in the Homeric epics, Hephaestus plays
                a minor role as the Olympian craftsman.</li>
            <li>Nonnus: In the epic poem Dionysiaca (fifth century CE), which relates the adventures of the young god
                Dionysus, Hephaestus is recruited by his mother, Hera, to help the Indians fight against Dionysus.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Virgil: Vulcan (the Roman equivalent of Hephaestus) appears in his typical epic role in Book 8 of the
                Aeneid (19 BCE), making a suit of armor for the protagonist Aeneas.</li>
            <li>Ovid: The myths of Vulcan/Hephaestus feature in some of Ovid’s poetry, such as the Metamorphoses (ca. 8
                CE).</li>
            <li>Statius: The fifth poem of Book 1 of the Silvae (first century CE) is one of the only works to present a
                positive image of the relationship between Vulcan/Hephaestus and Venus/Aphrodite. In Statius’ epic
                Thebaid, however, the married couple is back to their typical bickering and jealousy.</li>
