            <span class="bolder">Cervantes</span>
            <p>In this style I wanted to pay tribute to one of the greatest figures of the literary genre: <span class="bolder">Miguel de Cervantes</span>, focusing on the original version of his disruptive masterpiece, <span class="bolder">Don Quijote de la Mancha.</span>
                As obviously at that time books only existed in the physical format, I first tried to recreate the full experience of reading the <span class="bolder">Don Quijote</span>, but it turned out to be quite hard to implement there any kind of text
                <a href="issues/book_filled_template.html">(you can take a glance HERE)</a>. That's the reason I eventually opted for a more simpler but effective way. I tried to recreate the one column layout with symetrical borders, as well as a bigger first letter of each
                new paragraph as it was done on the original version, as well as in many other books from that time. Here are the images I took references from:
            </p>

            <span class="bolder">Appearence and font</span>
            <p>To give it that old appearence I applied shadowing on the borders, as well as using a noise image to give it that granular effect so it seems more antique.
                Regarding the election of the font, I selected the Gutenberg font, alluding to the original style of Blackletter for the Gutenberg, called <span class="bolder">Donatus-Kalender</span>. The <span class="bolder">Gutenberg</span> font is the digital adaptation of the typeface.

            <span class="bolder">Industrial Revolution</span>
            <p>With the Industrial Revolution style, I tried to inspire in those first newspapers of the beginning of the 19th century that started being produced massively and industrially. I tried to apply the <span class="bolder">"inverted pyramid"</span><a href="https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/stratcommwriting/chapter/inverted-pyramid-style/"> technique</a> , that implies information is displayed in order of importance, displaying it in 5 columns regarding the importance.
                    However, to mantain the homogeinity with the rest of the project, I went with a single column display. Newspapers during the early 1800s started becoming cheaper when both sides of the page could be printed at once, but still their structure was quite simple and didn't change much from what was a century ago.</p>

            <p class="bolder">Cover page:</p>
            <p>Both the <span class="bolder">size</span> and the <span class="bolder">font family</span> comply with the
                instructions provided by Cassandre and his colleagues. As suggested by a Bifur promotional brochure, the
                <span class="bolder">Bifur font</span> was specifically designed for <span
                    class="bolder">headings</span>, while it should not be used for text. The same document also
                introduces four different sizes: we have used the largest one (60pt) for the main heading of the whole
                article, while the third size (36pt) was chosen to indicate the author. The remaining elements on the
                cover require a simpler and more balanced style, thus, we have adopted the uppercase <span
                    class="bolder">Peignot font</span>, whose sizes have been suggested by the following example page:
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This same document also inspired the layout of the page and the background of the cover. For those
                articles whose cover has an opening image, the adopted filters are “greyscale (100%)” and “contrast
                (300%)”. This style imitates some gouaches produced by Cassandre in the 1930s and characterizes all the
                images of the article. Moreover, the cover image is shaped like a square</p>

            <p class="bolder">Article body:</p>
            <p>The body of the articles contains many different elements. The page presents a special type of <span
                    class="bolder">borders</span>, created using the letter A of the Bifur font. This type of textual
                ornament was suggested by both the above-mentioned brochure and the following document: <a
                    href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/46165392@N05/44555950915/in/dateposted/" target="_blank">click
                    here to open the link in a new tab</a>.</p>
            <p>The <span class="bolder">headings</span> have different sizes depending on their level. Following the
                idea expressed concerning the main title (h1), h2 will be 48pt large, h3 is 36pt, and h4 is 24pt.
                Instead, the paragraph font size will be 14pt, except for the publication note/abstract (18pt) and
                image-captions (12pt).</p>

            <p class="bolder">Colours:</p>
            <p>We have already explained (above <em>Cover page</em>) the reason behind the choice of image filters and
                the backgrounds. Now it’s time to deal with text colours: <code class="bolder"
                    style="color:#cf4b3a">#cf4b3a</code> and <code class="bolder" style="color:#656770">#656770</code>.
            <p>These colours have been retrieved from Img. 2 (above) and perfectly fit the need to combine two of the
                <span class="bolder">most frequent colours</span> used by Cassandre. Moreover, the bicoloured style is
                suggested by the Bifur font brochure, while the red colour was often adopted by the typist for styling
                the first letter of a Peignot font paragraph:
            </p>

            <p>The same colours alternation characterizes the paragraphs’ title and the structure of boxes (<code

            <p>The 1960s style is inspired by the <span class="bolder">hippie movement</span>, one of the best examples
                of the XX century counterculture. The flower children were famous not only because of their ideology,
                but also thanks to their <span class="bolder">eccentric and colourful style</span>, whose symbols still
                characterizes many retro works of art.</p>

                retrieves the multi-layered structure of the image on the left, while the headings (h2, h3, h4) of the
                article body present a gradually simpler text-shadow depending on their level (image on the right).</p>

            <span class="bolder">Start of the XXI century</span>
            <p> In this theme, I decided to explore the manga style and its essential features.
                <br> Specifically, I focused on the inner structure of a manga comic, composed by a set of panels, thin
                lines and black ink.
                <br> Mangas originated from scrolls dating back to the 12th century, but they started to be associated
                with the concept of western comics just in the 18th century; at the start of the XXI century, mangas had
                acquired a
                characteristic font and an overall <span class="bolder"> essential </span> panel composition.
            </p>
            <p class="bolder">Examples:</p>

            <p class="bolder">Headings and paragraphs:</p>
            <p> When considering the headings, I decided to take direct inspiration from the fonts used in the Neon
                Genesis Evangelion franchise.
                <br> My decision was guided primarily by the impact that this manga had during its production and
                release time, and also by
                its history: Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the few cases in which the animation series (anime, in
                Japanese) came before
                its comic-book counterpart. This transition, however, didn't change the typographical or stylistic
                nature of the franchise, but,
                actually, contributed to making it iconic and unforgettable, a fundamental part of the narrative itself.

            <br>
            <p> It was, however, more difficult to integrate a classic manga panel structure within a dense wall of
                text, our articles:
                I tried, at first, to divide every paragraph in sections contained in boxes and to recreate the correct
                way to read
                a manga (from right to left and from top to bottom, as explained by this <a

                    article<a>.)
                        However, at the end I decided to go for a more <span class="bolder">versatile asset</span>,
                        maybe simpler, but absolutely relevant to this style and
                        its main characteristics.

                                    <br> The shadows applied to the titles and headings are a reference to the same

                                    to create more <span class="bolder">depth and contrast</span> between the header

            <p> The main inspiration behind this theme is the solarpunk aesthetic and its interpretations.
                <br> We can define solarpunk as a science fiction literary subgenre and art movement, which investigates
                and explores
                an optimistic vision of the future: humans come together to win climate change's challenges and
                obstacles, and therefore manage to
                create a sustanaible existence for the entire planet.
                As a complete opposite of the cyberpunk genre, solarpunk's aesthetic is <span
                    class="bolder">bright</span> and deeply influenced by Art Deco, while from a philosophical point of
                view it takes many values from eco-modernism,
                anti-consumerism and positive psychology.

                contributed to shape the paragraphs'
                style and structure: my idea was to create an interface similar to the one of an old cathode tube screen
                (like <a
                    href="https://www.eljugondemovil.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/El-Jugon-De-Movil-Pip-Boy-Portada-1280x720.jpg">those</a>
                that you could
                find in the world of Fallout), with a dark background and a flickering display, and to complete it with
                fonts and colors coming
                directly from the solarpunk aesthetic (earth tones, various shades of green). </p>
            <p> Let's now focus on this theme's fonts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bolder"> Brassia </span> is a (left): font created by Ariel Martín Pérez, member of the
                    Velvetyne Type Foundry,
                    during a workshop hold on February the 14th 2019 in occasion of the Fig. Festival in Liège, Belgium.
                    <br> Completely designed to represent a contemporary interpretation of the solarpunk genre,
                    Brassia's name derives from
                    the city of Brussels, Brasseurs and by a botanical genus of orchids; it is free to download, modify
                    and use.
                </li>
                <li><span class="bolder"> CourierPrime </span> was instead chosen for being one of the most economical
                    and eco-sustainable fonts,
                    according to multiple sources, and therefore it is perfect for a solarpunk interface.
                    This theme implements it in all of its paragraphs. </li>
